"""
Mother/child adapter range check.

Usage:
    python range_check.py                      # defaults to adapters_mother
    python range_check.py adapters_mother_v2   # test a specific adapter
    python range_check.py adapters_child_v2 --child

The adapter path is a COMMAND-LINE ARGUMENT, not hardcoded. The script
prints exactly which adapter it loaded, so the output is unambiguous
about what was actually tested.

What we're checking: does the adapter produce a RANGE of response
quality, or does it collapse to memorized training lines? Repeated
identical output across samples at temp=0.9 means memorization -- which
matters because the later GRPO loop needs multiple DISTINCT candidate
responses at a decision point to rank against each other.
