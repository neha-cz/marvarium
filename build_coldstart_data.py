"""
Cold-start SFT data for the mother and child personas -- EXPANDED.

Why this rewrite: at 24 examples, train loss hit 0.032 against val loss
0.764. The adapter memorized the set rather than generalizing, and
probes returned training lines verbatim. The structural fix is more
data with MULTIPLE DISTINCT PHRASINGS PER SITUATION TYPE, so there is
something to generalize across.

Design rules, unchanged from before:
  - Role and format coherence only. The attachment disposition comes
    from the GRPO loop later, not from here.
  - Real breadth of response quality. Warm/attentive sits alongside
    distracted, dismissive, impatient, overwhelmed, delayed. An
    idealized dataset leaves the later loop nothing to rank.

New rule:
  - Every SITUATION TYPE appears 4-5 times, with different wording and
    different response qualities. No situation gets exactly one
    canonical answer to memorize.

Recommended training flags given ~70 examples and 10.5M trainable
params (default all-layers overfit badly at 24):
    --num-layers 8
    --iters 200        (but watch val loss, stop where it bottoms out)
