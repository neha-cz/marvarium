"""
Persona sanity checks after cold-start SFT.

Two checks:
  1. Both adapters stay in character on situations NOT in the training data.
  2. The mother adapter still shows a RANGE of response quality when
     sampled at temperature -- not just uniformly warm/attentive.

Check 2 is the one that matters for what comes next: if every sample is
warm and attentive, the deliberate quality spread in the cold-start data
didn't survive training, and the later GRPO loop will have no meaningful
alternatives to rank against each other.
